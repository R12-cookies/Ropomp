# Ropomp
Arduino Based bluetooth controlled Fire Fighting Robot truck
There are 4 parts to cover 
1-Wheels and the pump
2-The bluetooth module + the app
3-Water tube (servo)
4-Final code 

we'll be working in teams, each team will work on a specific section.
As a first step in this project, The teams are expected to realize and test the parts on both hardware and software levels. 
When a team finishes working on the given part they are expected to explain everything to the other team members, so that we are all on the same track. also the team who finishes before the others should split and help the other teams to finish.
this file contains some basic tutorials for the different parts, each ciruit u test or code u write will be saved in this repository.
